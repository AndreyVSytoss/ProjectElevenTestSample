# Project Eleven Sample

Here is first draft version and my ideas about REST API Services of Project Eleven Testing.

Stack of Technologies and Libraries:
 * JAVA based Framework;
 * JUnit for Test Case archestration;
 * Maven - project management and comprehension tool;
 * REST Assured - simple Java library for testing of REST services;
 * Hamcrest - asserts Matcher;
 * Jackson - Object Mapper from/to JSON;
 * Allure Report (optional) - provide good representation of test execution output
